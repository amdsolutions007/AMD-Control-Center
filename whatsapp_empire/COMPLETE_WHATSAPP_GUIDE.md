## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### "I can't get SMS code on small phone"

**Solution:**
1. Make sure phone has signal
2. SMS may take 1-2 minutes
3. Try "Call me" option instead (WhatsApp will call you with code)

### "My contacts didn't sync"

**Solution:**
1. Wait 5-10 minutes (can take time)
2. Check internet connection
3. Restart WhatsApp Desktop
4. Contacts should appear

### "Broadcast not sending"

**Solution:**
1. Recipients must have your number saved
2. Check internet connection
3. Try smaller batch first (50 contacts)
4. Wait between batches

### "Channel not growing"

**Solution:**
1. Share link more (everywhere!)
2. Post more consistently
3. Add more value (less selling)
4. Engage with comments
5. Cross-promote on other platforms

## 📱 WHATSAPP BUSINESS VS REGULAR WHATSAPP

### Regular WhatsApp:
- Personal use
- Can have broadcast lists
- Can create channel
- Limited business features

### WhatsApp Business:
- Business profile (hours, location, website)
- Quick replies (save templates)
- Away messages (auto-reply when busy)
- Labels (organize contacts)
- Catalog (show products)
- Better for business!

**Recommendation:** Use WhatsApp Business!

**How to switch:**
1. Download WhatsApp Business (separate app)
2. Use same number
3. Import all data
4. ✅ Better features!
