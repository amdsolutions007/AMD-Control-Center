**BOOK DESCRIPTION TEMPLATE (Copy-Paste):**

```
What if I told you that ₦100 per day—less than the cost of a beer—could generate ₦9.125 million over 25 years?

In "Little Drop 💧 Mighty Ocean," Nigerian father and software engineer Olawale Shoyemi reveals the exact system he used to:
✅ Save ₦730,000 for his daughter's university education (from ₦100/day over 20 years)
✅ Build a ₦9.125M family wealth fund (₦1,000/day over 25 years)
✅ Break the cycle of poverty in his family—without winning the lottery, without inheritance, without miracles

This isn't a "get rich quick" scheme. It's a proven, step-by-step discipline that works whether you earn ₦30,000/month or ₦300,000/month.

INSIDE THIS BOOK, YOU'LL DISCOVER:
• The "Paying for Air" analogy that exposes why we say "I can't afford to save"
• The Family Formula: How to structure ₦1,000/day across 4 children, spouse, yourself, and emergencies
• The Battery Lesson: Why Mr. A's inconsistent ₦2,000 savings failed (and what to do instead)
• The 2-Year Rule: How to "plant" money in Fixed Deposits for 10-15% annual compound growth
• The "No Savings, No Love" doctrine: Why preparation equals love (Biblical proof included)
• 365-Day Interactive Worksheet: Track your progress from Day 1 to millionaire status

WHO THIS BOOK IS FOR:
✓ Parents who want to fund their children's education without debt
✓ Young professionals tired of living paycheck-to-paycheck
✓ Anyone who's ever said "I don't have money to save" (but buys beer, data, cigarettes)
✓ Families stuck in generational poverty looking for a way out

WHAT READERS ARE SAYING:
"My 10-year-old daughter read this and started saving every birthday gift. Now she has ₦50,000 at age 12." — Adebayo, Lagos

"I thought I needed millions to invest. Olawale proved I just needed discipline." — Chioma, Abuja

THE PROOF IS IN THE MATH:
₦100/day × 365 days × 20 years = ₦730,000
₦1,000/day × 365 days × 25 years = ₦9,125,000
With 10-15% Fixed Deposit interest: ₦15-20 MILLION total

Poverty isn't about your salary. It's about what you do with your salary.

Start your Little Drop today. Your Mighty Ocean is waiting.

---

📖 Bonus: Includes signed pledge certificate template and CEO's direct WhatsApp line for accountability.

🌍 Global Vision: If 1% of the world (80M people) saved $1/day, that's $29.2 billion/year in family security. Let's end poverty—one drop at a time.

💬 "Papa, can I do this too?"

That's what my 10-year-old daughter asked when I showed her the passbook.

She saw ₦365,000 saved. Just from ₦100 daily drops.

She cried. Not because of the amount.
But because she understood:

"My father loved me enough to PREPARE."

From that day, she started saving EVERYTHING.
Birthday gifts. Holiday money. Pocket change.

She's 20 now. ₦300,000+ saved.
Teaching her younger siblings the same habit.
