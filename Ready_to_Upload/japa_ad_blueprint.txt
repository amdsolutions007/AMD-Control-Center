JAPA AD — 3-CLIP BLUEPRINT (Vertical 9:16)

Notes:
- Recommended format: 1080x1920 (9:16), 24–30fps
- Pace: fast, direct delivery; keep each clip ~3–6 seconds
- Keep mouth visibility high for lip sync (no extreme head turns)

CLIP 1: THE HOOK (Introduction)
Goal: Grab attention. Stop the scroll.

Audio/Script (For Lip Sync):
"Stop guessing if you can Japa. I built an AI that tells you the brutal truth in exactly 5 seconds."

Visual Prompt:
"Cinematic medium shot of a Nigerian tech CEO in a striped shirt sitting in a modern office. He looks directly into the camera lens with a serious, urgent expression. He leans forward slightly, making eye contact, speaking with authority. High quality, 4k, photorealistic."

Direction Notes:
- Start with an assertive look, slight lean-in on "Stop guessing"
- Minimal hand movement; sell intensity through eye contact


CLIP 2: THE DEMO (Gesturing to the App)
Goal: Show them how it works.

Audio/Script (For Lip Sync):
"You just type your savings here. Green means pack your bags. Red means sit down and build your empire at home."

Visual Prompt:
"Medium shot of a Nigerian man in a striped shirt. He looks at the camera but gestures with his left hand towards the empty space on the right side of the screen. He points to the side as if showing a chart, nodding his head in agreement. Professional lighting, office background."

Direction Notes:
- Frame him slightly left-of-center to leave empty space on the right for UI overlay
- Gesture timing:
  - point right on "type your savings here"
  - nod on "Green means pack your bags"
  - firmer expression on "Red means sit down"


CLIP 3: THE CALL TO ACTION (The Link)
Goal: Make them click.

Audio/Script (For Lip Sync):
"Don't get stranded abroad. Check your Japa Score right now completely free. The link is in the description."

Visual Prompt:
"Close up shot. The man smiles confidently and points his finger downwards repeatedly. He looks trustworthy and encouraging. He nods and gives a thumbs up at the end. 4k resolution, highly detailed."

Direction Notes:
- Point downward starting on "Check your Japa Score"
- Thumbs up at the end of the last sentence
