🚨 Why 90% of CVs Never Reach Human Recruiters

Most job seekers don't know this: Their CV is being rejected by AI before any human sees it.

It's called ATS (Applicant Tracking System).

❌ Wrong file format
❌ Missing keywords
❌ Poor structure
❌ Fancy graphics that confuse AI
❌ No quantified achievements

Solution? Get your CV analyzed by AI first.

We offer professional CV analysis:
✅ ATS compatibility check
✅ Keyword optimization
✅ Format recommendations
✅ Industry-specific tips

Investment: ₦5,000
Delivery: 24 hours

DM me or WhatsApp: +234 913 449 2041

### **TWITTER/X THREAD**
```
🧵 Your CV is probably being rejected by AI

Here's why (and how to fix it):

1/ 90% of companies use ATS (Applicant Tracking System)

It scans your CV BEFORE humans see it.

If your CV isn't ATS-friendly, you're automatically rejected.

Even if you're qualified.

2/ Common ATS killers:

❌ Tables and columns
❌ Headers/footers
❌ Images and graphics
❌ Wrong keywords
❌ Fancy fonts
❌ Saved as image/PDF

Most CVs fail on at least 3 of these.

3/ What ATS looks for:

✅ Specific keywords from job description
✅ Clean, simple formatting
✅ Standard section headings
✅ Measurable achievements
✅ Proper file format

Miss these = Auto-reject

4/ Real example:

"Managed team" = Ignored
"Led 8-person team, increased productivity 40%" = Passes ATS

Specificity and numbers are key.

5/ Solution?

Get your CV analyzed by AI before submitting.

We check:
• ATS compatibility score
• Missing keywords
• Format issues
• Industry standards

₦5,000 | 24hr delivery

DM for analysis

6/ Stop applying blindly.

Know your CV's real chances.

Retweet to help someone land their dream job 🙏
